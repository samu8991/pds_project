# ParallelGraphColoring

---

This project is about solving a famous problem in informatics called vertex coloring problem.
The problem is defined as follows: given a graph G=(V,E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set
of edges of the graph you have to find a function C
: V --> N capable of assigning a color to each vertex
such that for each (u,v) in E C(v) != C(u).
